# EnzLab

EnzLab enables you to carry out a study of enzyme kinetics using computer simulation. You can obtain a large amount of (simulated) experimental data in a very short time, and so can concentrate on planning your experimental strategy.

The computer generates an enzyme (of a chosen type) at random. You can then carry out experiments with the enzyme varying the volumes of enzyme solution used, the pH and the concentration of substrate and inhibitor.

The program allows you to determine the precision of your experiments, and to analyse your results to obtain values for the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> and hence also obtain information about the inhibitor.

EnzLab was originally developed by  Doug Clow, John Garratt and Peter Groves, Department of Chemistry, University of York, UK. The OS X version was produced in 2014 by Andrew Booth, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, United Kingdom.
