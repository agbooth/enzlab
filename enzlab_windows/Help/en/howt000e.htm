<P><B>Experimental data required</B></P>

<P>You must perform experiments over a range of pH (keeping all other parameters constant). A reasonable strategy would be to take measurements across the whole useful pH range (4 to 10) in steps of 1 pH unit, and fill in the gaps as appropriate.</P>

<P><B>Analysing the data</B></P>

<P>Choose <B>pH Profile</B> from the <B>Analysis</B> menu. This brings up the pH Profile Selection dialog box. Here you select the experiments you want to include in the profile, remembering that they must differ only in pH used.</P>

<P>When you have selected, the program displays a scatter plot of rate <B>V<font face="Arial" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font></B> against pH, which you can print out.</P>
