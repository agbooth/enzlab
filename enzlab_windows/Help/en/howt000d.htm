<P><B>Experimental data required</B></P>

<P>You must perform experiments over a range of substrate concentrations (keeping all other parameters constant).</P>

<P>You will not obtain good results unless there is a significant change in the rate over the range of substrate concentrations you use.</P>

<P><B>Analysing the data</B></P>

<P>Choose <B>Kinetics</B> from the <B>Analysis</B> menu.    This brings up the Kinetic Analysis Selection dialog box. Here you select the experiments you want to include in the analysis, remembering that they must differ only in the concentration of substrate used.</P>

<P>When you have selected, the program uses a nonlinear least mean squares method to fit your data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, obtaining values for K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>. These values are displayed, along with a graph of <B>V<font face="Arial" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font></B> against <B>S</B> showing your data points and the calculated line of best fit.</P>
