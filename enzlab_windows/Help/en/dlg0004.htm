<P>The Examination of Kinetic Analysis Results dialog box shows which experimental points were taken at substrate concentrations greater than 50 times the value you have just obtained for K<sub>m</sub>.</P>

<P>These points tell you very little about your enzyme. Consequently, the program will label these points as 'N/A', for 'Not Available', from now on. You will not be able to use these points in any subsequent analyses.</P>

<P>The graph of your results is shown, with a dotted vertical line marking 50 K<sub>m</sub>. Any points to the right of this line will be marked as 'N/A'.</P>

<P><B>OK button</B><BR>
Click on <B>OK</B> when you have finished.</P>
