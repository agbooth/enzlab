<P><B>General strategy</B></P>

<P>You must think carefully about</P>
<ul>
<li>what you want to know</li>

<li>what you already know - about enzymes in general and about your particular enzyme</li>
</ul>

<P>Remind yourself how the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction depends on</P>
<ul>
<li>the substrate concentration</li>

<li>the enzyme concentration</li>

</ul>

<P>You may assume your enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. (To remind yourself, sketch graphs of <B>V<font face="Arial" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font></B> against <B>S</B> and <B>V<font face="Arial" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font></B> against <B>E</B>.)</P>

<P><B>Aims of your study</B></P>
<ul>
<li>What is the enzyme's pH optimum?</li>

<li>What effect does pH have on K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>?</li>

<li>Does azide inhibit substrate binding, the catalytic process, or both?</li>

<li>What is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex?</li>

<li>How precise are your measurements of the reaction rate?</li>
</ul>
<P>There is no single correct way to answer these questions. You must choose your own preferred strategy.</P>

<P><B>Points to bear in mind</B></P>
<ul>
<li>How far can you get without knowing the precision of your measurements? (You have already used the assay procedure and so must have some confidence in it.)</li>

<li>Your studies of pH will be much helped if you have at least an estimate of K<sub>m</sub> at a standard pH.</li>

<li>Your studies of the inhibitor will be much helped if you have at least some information obtained in the absence of inhibitor - the more the better.</li>

<li>You have a limited supply of enzyme.</li>
</ul>
<P>Also bear in mind that it is efficient, in the laboratory, to make few changes to your experimental conditions on a given day. A series of kinetic runs in which you change all parameters (vol, pH, S, I) is more cumbersome than a series in which you change only one.</P>
