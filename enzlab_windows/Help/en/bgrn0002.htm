<P>You have isolated a bacterial enzyme and wish to compare it with its mammalian homologues. Since the isolation and purification have taken some months, you know a fair bit about the enzyme already:</P>

<ul>
<li>The assay procedure you have developed will measure rates between 0.2 and 10 &micro;moles per minute. (A spectroscopic technique is used to follow the concentration of product. The rate is determined from the slope of a graph of absorbance against time.)</li>

<li>The enzyme has significant activity at pH 7.0 (this may not be the pH optimum).</li>

<li>The enzyme is stable when frozen, but loses activity after being thawed for 24 hours.</li>

<li>The enzyme is inhibited by azide.</li>
</ul>
<P>You have prepared and frozen six samples of 0.5mL enzyme solution, each of which should be sufficient for a day's work.</P>
