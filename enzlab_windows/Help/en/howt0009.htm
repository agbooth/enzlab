<P><B>Setting the parameters</B></P>

<P>The current values of the experimental parameters are set in the boxes on the left-hand side of the main screen of EnzLab. [If they are empty, they have the value zero.]</P>

<P>The easiest way to change them is to click in the box you want (a cursor will appear in the box), and then type the value, deleting the old one if necessary. You can also make the cursor appear by choosing <B>Experiment</B> from the menu - the cursor appears in the box you last changed.</P>

<P>You can move the cursor between the boxes by pressing the <B>Tab</B> key on the keyboard, or by clicking in a different box.</P>

<P><B>Performing the experiment</B></P>

<P>Either:</P>
<ul>
<li>click on the <B>Go</B> button at the bottom on the left [if you have changed the parameters]</li>

<li>or click on the <B>Repeat</B> button at the bottom on the left [if you want to repeat the experiment you just did and have not changed any parameters]</li>

</ul>

<P>Only one of the two buttons will be active at any time, depending on  whether you have changed the parameters since last time or not.</P>

<P>N.B. Don't press <B>Enter</B> until you have set all the parameters correctly!</P>

<P><B>The result</B></P>

<P>The value of the initial rate, <B>V<font face="Arial" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font></B>, obtained for the parameters you selected will be displayed between the boxes and the buttons. You can also view a list of all your results to date by choosing <B>List Results</B> from the <B>Results</B> menu.</P>
