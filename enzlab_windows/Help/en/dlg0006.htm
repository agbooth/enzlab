<P>The Kinetic Analysis Selection dialog box is where you select the experiments for an analysis of your enzyme's kinetics.</P>

<P><B>List box</B><BR>
Experiments that are currently selected are highlighted in the list box. (If you have performed more than six experiments, click on the arrows to move up and down through the list.)</P>

<P><B>Selecting and Unselecting experiments</B></P>
<ul>
<li>In the boxes to the left, enter the values of the parameters (<B>Vol</B>, <B>pH</B> and <B>I</B>) of the experiments you want.<BR>
All experiments whose parameters match those in the boxes are selected.</li>

<li>Click with the mouse on an unselected experiment in the list box.<BR>
All experiments whose parameters match that experiment's are selected, and those parameters put into the boxes.</li>

<li>Hold down <B>Ctrl</B> on the keyboard while clicking on an already selected experiment.<BR>
That experiment (alone) will be unselected.</li>

<li>Hold down <B>Ctrl</B> on the keyboard while clicking and dragging over a range of already selected experiments.<BR>
Those experiments will be unselected.</li>
</ul>

<P>Initially, the boxes will hold the values from the last experiment you performed, and all matching experiments will be highlighted.</P>

<P><B>No. of expts selected</B><BR>
The box at the bottom of the screen keeps count of how many experiments you have selected - you need at least five.</P>

<P><B>OK button</B><BR>
When you have selected the experiments you wish, click on <B>OK</B> to perform the analysis.</P>

<P><B>Cancel button</B><BR>
If you don't want to perform a kinetic analysis, click on <B>Cancel</B>.</P>
