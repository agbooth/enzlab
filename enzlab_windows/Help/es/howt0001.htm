<P>$<B>Using Windows </B></P>

<P>#KThis introduction is only a very brief guide to using Microsoft Windows; you should refer to Microsoft documentation for more information. (Try the Microsoft Windows User's Guide, or run the Microsoft Windows Tutorial program.)</P>

<P><B>Windows terminology</B><BR>
To <B>point</B> with the mouse is to move the mouse until the mouse pointer (the arrow) rests on the item of choice.<BR>
To <B>click</B> with the mouse is to quickly press and release the mouse button while pointing at the item to be clicked.<BR>
To <B>double-click</B> with the mouse is to click the mouse button twice in rapid succession.<BR>
To <B>drag</B> an item is to point at it, and then hold down the mouse button while you move the mouse.</P>

<P><B>Parts of a window</B></P>

<P>유t the left of the top line is the <B>Control-menu box</B>. Clicking on this box activates a pull down menu that lets you resize, move, minimize and maximize the window.</P>

<P>유t the far right of the top line are the <B>Minimize</B> and <B>Maximize</B> buttons; clicking one of these shrinks the window to an icon or enlarges it to take up the whole screen respectively.</P>

<P>윲he area between these two is the <B>title bar</B>. Dragging the title bar moves the window around the screen.</P>

<P>윲he next line down holds the menu bar. Clicking on words on this bar activates the corresponding <B>pull-down menu</B>.<BR>
(See Using pull-down menus.)</P>

<P>윲he border of the window can be used to resize the window; point at the edge you wish to move (the mouse pointer will change shape) and drag the edge until the window is the correct shape.</P>

<P><B>The enzymeLAB window</B><BR>
The enzymeLAB window has the following elements:</P>

<P>율n the top right-hand corner is the clock, showing the current simulation day and time.</P>

<P>율n the top left-hand corner is an indicator showing how much thawed enzyme solution is left.</P>

<P>율mmediately below this are the edit boxes, where you set the parameters for an experimental run, and the <B>Go</B> and <B>Repeat</B> buttons that perform an experiment.<BR>
(See Performing an experiment.)</P>

<P>윲he rest of the window shows the graph of product concentration versus time for the last experiment you did.</P>
