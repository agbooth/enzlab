<font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">

<p><b>Enzyme selection</b></p>

<p>First, you must select the type of enzyme you wish to work with, using the Enzyme Selection dialog box. The characteristics of your enzyme are generated randomly, and the reference number of your enzyme displayed, along with some additional information which you should record. You can redisplay this information at any time by choosing <b>Information</b> from the <b>Enzyme</b> menu.</p>

<p><b>Starting the day</b></p>

<p>The program then simulates the course of a normal working day. When you arrive in the morning, you must decide how many samples of enzyme (if any) you wish to thaw for the day's work, and plan your experimental strategy for the day (see Planning your experimental strategy).</p>

<p><b>Experiments</b></p>

<p>During the day, the time is displayed and advances whenever you:</p>

<ul>
<li>perform an experiment  (see <a href="howt0009.htm">Performing an experiment</a>)</li>

<li>analyse the precision of your experiments (see <a href="howt000c.htm">Assessing experimental precision</a>)</li>

<li>analyse the enzyme's kinetics (see <a href="howt000d.htm">Performing a kinetic analysis</a>).</li>

<li>obtain a pH profile of your enzyme (see <a href="howt000e.htm">Obtaining a pH Profile</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ending the day</b></p>

<p>You can end a working day in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by choosing <b>Go Home</b> from the <b>Go Home</b> menu</li>

<li>by saying you don't want to work late when the computer reminds you of how late it is</li>

<li>if you are still working at midnight, the program sends you home anyway</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of each day, any remaining thawed enzyme is lost, and the program will ask if you wish to do another day's work. If you answer &quot;yes&quot;, the next day starts; answering &quot;no&quot; ends the program.</p>

<p><b>Saving and loading</b></p>

<p>You can save all the work you have done to disk at any time, so that you can leave the program and come back to it later (see Saving your current work and Reloading your work from disk).</p>
