<p>You must, as in real life, keep a record of your experiments as you perform them.</p>

<p>When you have selected an enzyme, you should record its name and reference  number, and also its concentration and specific activity. (To redisplay this information at any time, choose <b>Information</b> from the <b>Enzyme</b> menu.)</p>

<p>Each 'day', you should write down what you propose to study. At the start of each series of experimental runs, make a note of what you are trying to find out and how you intend to do it.</p>

<p>Keep a sensible, tabular record of all your results, and plot each value of V<font face="Geneva" size="1"><sub>o</sub></font> on a suitable graph when you obtain it. (You can display the program's list of results by choosing <b>List Results</b> from the <b>Results</b> menu.)</p>

<p>When you have finished work with an enzyme, summarise your conclusions about its activity.</p>
