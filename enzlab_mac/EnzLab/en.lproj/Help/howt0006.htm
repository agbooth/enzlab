<font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">
<ul>
<li>At what pH have you already assayed your enzyme? (See <a href="bgrn0002.htm">Background to your study.</a>)</li>

<li>Do you want to establish basic information about your enzyme by continuing to work at this or a nearby pH?</li>

<li>Do you know enough about your enzyme to want to study its kinetic parameters at other pH values?</li>

<li>Over what range of pH values can you expect a typical enzyme to remain active?</li>

<li>If you want to get an indication of the sensitivity of your enzyme to pH, would you work at a substrate concentration that is always high enough to saturate the enzyme, or never high enough to saturate the enzyme?</li>
