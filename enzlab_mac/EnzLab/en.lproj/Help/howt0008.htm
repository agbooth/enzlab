<font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">
<ul>
<li>Do you know enough about your enzyme to want to use the inhibitor?</li>

<li>What range of values would you expect for the dissociation constant of an  enzyme-inhibitor complex? <br />
 (Do you think it would be about the same as the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex, much larger than this value, or much smaller than this value?)</li>

<li>Use your answer to give you an idea of the concentration of inhibitor needed to combine with half the available enzyme (in the absence of substrate).</li>

<li>Do you want to add enough inhibitor to reduce the reaction rate to a negligible value, have little effect on the reaction rate, or somewhere in between?</li>
