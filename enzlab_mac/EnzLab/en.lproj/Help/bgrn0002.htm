<font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2">

<p>You have isolated a bacterial enzyme and wish to compare it with its mammalian homologues. Since the isolation and purification have taken some months, you know a fair bit about the enzyme already:</p>

<ul>
<li>The assay procedure you have developed will measure rates between 0.2 and 10 Âµmoles per minute. (A spectroscopic technique is used to follow the concentration of product. The rate is determined from the slope of a graph of absorbance against time.)</li>

<li>The enzyme has significant activity at pH 7.0 (this may not be the pH optimum).</li>

<li>The enzyme is stable when frozen, but loses activity after being thawed for 24 hours.</li>

<li>The enzyme is inhibited by azide.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have prepared and frozen six samples of 0.5mL enzyme solution, each of which should be sufficient for a day's work.</p>
